Powerful Network Packet Analyzer tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic. 
It provides detailed insights into source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and even payload data. 
This tool is a great addition for educational purposes, ensuring ethical use of network analysis. 
Using Python I have programed this tool which is capable of capturing pacakets and gives information like Source Ip, Destination Ip, Protocols, Payloads(if any).
